canon github madness lore:
so sonic was just enjoying his day but dr eggman had a machine that transported sonic in too a hole of nothing
but he did not know he was inside a disasm that was edited by alot of people after 5 days sonic had enough, 
he went insane and along the way he found 3 others that were trapped inide the disasm.
after that they heard a voice saying "lets add this too the shc expo" they did not know what this meant.
Then, when they got to where Sonic would encounter Doctor Eggman, they instead found a Bubble Dragon, Bubblun, just opearting the egg mobile for fun. They don't know about the bubble dragon, so they just kick his ass.
